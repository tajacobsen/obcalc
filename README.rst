Installation
============
It may be necessary to edit customize.py to point to openbabel include and
library dirs.

Global installation::

    python2 setup.py install

User installation::

    python2 setup.py install --home=$HOME/opt
    export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/opt/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH

For Python3 please::

    cd swig
    swig -c++ -py3 -python obwrap.i
    mv obwrap.py ../obcalc

NOTE: This compilation precedure is only necessary as the upstream openbabel
python wrapper does not wrap vector3. If/when this is fixed, the C code can be
removed. See the following bug for details:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2969937&group_id=40728&atid=428740
        
Introduction
============

OpenBabel is a chemical toolbox designed to speak the many languages of
chemical data. It's an open, collaborative project allowing anyone to search,
convert, analyze, or store data from molecular modeling, chemistry,
solid-state materials, biochemistry, or related areas.  

The obcalc.OBForceField calculator use the force fields (currently UFF and
ghemical) included in OpenBabel.

To use this calculator you need to have the OpenBabel python bindings
installed:

- Arch Linux: python2-openbabel

OpenBabel: http://www.openbabel.org

OBForceField Calculator Class
=============================

OBForceField(force_field='UFF', bonds=None)

Here is a detailed list of all the keywords for the calculator:

================ ========= ================  =================================================
keyword          type      default value     description
================ ========= ================  =================================================
``force_field``  ``str``   ``'UFF'``         Force field ('UFF', 'ghemical', 'GAFF', 'MMFF94')
``bonds``        ``list``  ``None``          List of bonds in molecule given as:
                                             [[begin atom idx, end atom idx, bond order], ...]
                                             If None OpenBabel will try to guess it. 
``txt``          ``str``   ``None``          Which file to write output too.  Defaults to
                                             stdout ('-').

Examples
========

Automatic bond detection 
------------------------

Here is an example of how to calculate the total energy CO::

  #!/usr/bin/env python2
  from ase.structure import molecule
  from obcalc import OBForceField
  
  atoms = molecule('CO')
  
  calc = OBForceField()
  atoms.set_calculator(calc)
  e = atoms.get_potential_energy()

Adding bonds manually
---------------------

If we want to relax e.g. CO2 starting with a very large interatomic distances,
OpenBabel will not detect the bonds and we have to put them manually::

  #!/usr/bin/env python2
  from ase import Atoms
  from ase.optimize import QuasiNewton
  from obcalc import OBForceField
  
  atoms = Atoms('OCO', [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
                        [3.0, 0.0, 0.0],
                        [6.0, 0.0, 0.0]])
  
  calc = OBForceField()
  atoms.set_calculator(calc)
  relax = QuasiNewton(atoms)
  relax.run(fmax=0.05)
  # This results in a even larger interatomic distances
  # Therefore we add two double bonds
  
  bonds = [[0, 1, 2], # Double bond between atom 0 and atom 1
           [1, 2, 2]] # Double bond between atom 1 and atom 2
  calc = OBForceField(bonds=bonds)
  atoms.set_calculator(calc)
  relax = QuasiNewton(atoms)
  relax.run(fmax=0.05)
  # This gives the expected results

Building molecules
==================
The code also contains a function which builds an atoms object from a SMILES
string. To build an azobenzene molecule you could do::

  #!/usr/bin/env python2
  from obcalc.tools import build_molecule
  atoms = build_molecule('C1=CC=CC=C1N=NC2=CC=CC=C2')

Or if you would build ethanol, you could do::

  atoms = build_molecule('CCO')
